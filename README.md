# 👋 Hi, I'm Mael Lacour

**XR & Full Stack Engineer | Bridging Neuroscience, Research & Immersive Tech | Founder in Progress**

I'm a Full Stack Developer and XR Engineer driven by a deep curiosity for how technology can augment human potential.

Currently, I build immersive tools for neuroscience research at the Fondation Campus Biotech Geneva, designing advanced VR/AR/MR experiences integrated with technologies like EEG, fMRI, and TMS. My work connects software engineering, experimental design, and human-computer interaction — empowering scientists at EPFL, UNIGE, and HUG to explore cognition in new ways.

Beyond research, I'm passionate about creating tech that matters. My side project, Studova, reflects my belief that autonomy, learning, and actionable insights unlock powerful outcomes for individuals and teams. I experiment with frameworks from Flutter to React, always pushing the boundaries of tech development.

## 🔎 About My Repositories

My repos reflect a rare blend of deep technical skill, research-driven innovation, and a passion for meaningful tech at the intersection of immersive experiences and cognitive science:

- **Interdisciplinary Integration:** You'll find custom pipelines and toolkits that interface with neuroscience hardware, streamlining experimental data collection and analysis.
- **Innovative User Interfaces:** My XR projects push the boundaries of human-computer interaction, designing intuitive interfaces for scientists and study participants alike.
- **Technical Breadth:** Projects built with Unity, Three.js, React, Flutter, and Python cover high-performance 3D graphics, cross-platform mobile/web, and full-stack architectures.
- **Open Collaboration:** I value open-source initiatives and collaborative tools, inviting contributions from researchers, engineers, and XR enthusiasts — let’s build great tools together!
